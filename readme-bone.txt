Rockwell B-1B Lancer "The Bone"


XXXXXX  Version Nr: 0009 14112007 XXXXXX



This aircraft model represents a hack of the B-1B variable wingsweep bomber. The available sweep angles are 15 (takeoff) 25 (slow flight) 45 (high altitude flight) 55/67 (low and high altitude fast flight). The wingsweep is simulated by adding lift/drag to the inner wing part. The outer wing part always stays at 67 degrees and represents the most accurate hack ;-). Afterburner is used for takeoff and for rapid climb maneuvers.

XXXX INSTRUCTIONS XXXX

Takeoff:

- swing wing to most forward position (15) --> button D/d (present at start)
- apply 1/2 flaps
- apply full throttle
- apply afterburners
- rotate at 160 - takeoff at 170/180 with full fuel weight

Flight:

- dependent on your altitude and speed choose 15/25/45/55/67 degrees wingweep (d/D)
- max speed at sea level is mach 1.1, at altitude mach 1.3, because of structural damage to engine inlets
- typical performance speed is around mach 0.8 - 0.95 @sea level and mach 0.9 - 1.1 at altitude.

- 15 degrees ws: used for takeoff/landing <290 knots @ sealevel
- 25 degrees ws: used for slow flight/refuelling < 360 knots @sealevel
- 45 degrees ws: used for cruise at high altitude (mach 0.6 - 0.75)
- 55 degrees ws: used for high/low alt flight (above mach 0.7)
- 67 degrees ws: used for high/low alt flight (above mach 0.8)


Landing:

- ws 15 degrees
- use 1/2 or 2/2 flaps
- touchdown speed is <180 knots with full fuel load, or 140 nearly empty



XXXX TERRAIN AVOIDANCE / FOLLOWING SYSTEMS XXXX

It's OSG baby!

Terrain Avoidance System (TAS)

Master switch activates terrain avoidance system (tas) (ON/OFF), range knob(RNG) setting for short distance terrain recognition setting (2.5)nm used for slow flying or a hard ride or switch to the medium setting (5)nm thats is used when flying faster (above 400kts @sl) and/or u want a more comfortably ride.
The CLR PLN settings are important as it clears terrain below the aircraft. The settings are 0, 100ft, 300ft, 500ft and 1000ft.
When the terrain avoid system gets active, it adds the desired clearance distance (CLR PLN) to your altitude and guides u over an obstacle. Afterwards it stays in horizontal flying mode, if you want e.g.:altitude hold mode you have to enable it manually again.

Terrain Following System (TFS)

There is a basic terrain following system (TFS) present. You have to enable the master switch ON/OFF, then the PRTY switch to TERRAIN FOLLOW. The PRTY switch toggles the build in tfs from flightgear named MAP(doesn't work very well with with tas) or enables the new tfs, native to the bone, by switching to TERRAIN FOLLOW especially when using the tas. The advantage of the new TFS system is its ability to look forward to scan the terrain in front of the plane. 
Note: Above water switch to MAP, over terrain back to TERRAIN FOLLOW.

The native tfs and the build in flightgear tfs(MAP) use the clearance settings from SET CLR.
The clearance settings start from 0ft and increase in 200ft increments up to 2000ft. A=0ft, B=200ft, C=400ft,..., F=1000ft,..., K=2000ft.

XXXX BLAST, FLARES, STROBE XXXX

Based on preexisting osg files some eyecandy for engine blast, strobe and flares was added.

It's OSG baby!
