Northrop B-1B Lancer "The Bone"

XXXXXX  Version Nr: 0001 10072007 XXXXXX


This aircraft model represents a hack of the B-1B variable wingsweep bomber. The available sweep angles are 15 (takeoff) 25 (slow flight) 45 (high altitude flight) 55 (low and high altitude fast flight). The wingsweep is simulated by adding lift/drag to the inner wing part. The outer wing part always stays at 55 degrees and represents the most accurate hack ;-). Afterburner is used for takeoff and for rapid climb maneuvers.

XXXX INSTRUCTIONS XXXX

Takeoff:

- swing wing to most forward position (15)
- apply 1/2 flaps
- apply full throttle
- apply afterburners
- rotate at 160 - takeoff at 170/180 with full fuel weight

Flight:

- dependent on your altitude and speed choose 15/25/45/55 degrees wingweep
- max speed at sea level is mach 1.3, because of structural damage to engine inlets
- 15 degrees ws: used for takeoff/landing <320 knots
- 25 degrees ws: used for slow flight/refuelling < 370 knots
- 45 degrees ws: used for cruise at high altitude
- 55 degrees ws: used for high/low alt flight
- ATTENTION: Aviod overspeed when using autopilot, as the plane tends to oscillating movement
-->needs to be fixed

Landing:

- ws 15 degrees
- use 1/2 or 2/2 flaps
- touchdown speed is 180/190 knots with full fuel load, or 140 nearly empty
