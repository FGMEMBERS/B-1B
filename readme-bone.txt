Rockwell B-1B Lancer "The Bone"

XXXXXX  Version Nr: 0002 27072007 XXXXXX


This aircraft model represents a hack of the B-1B variable wingsweep bomber. The available sweep angles are 15 (takeoff) 25 (slow flight) 45 (high altitude flight) 55 (low and high altitude fast flight). The wingsweep is simulated by adding lift/drag to the inner wing part. The outer wing part always stays at 55 degrees and represents the most accurate hack ;-). Afterburner is used for takeoff and for rapid climb maneuvers.

XXXX INSTRUCTIONS XXXX

Takeoff:

- swing wing to most forward position (15)
- apply 1/2 flaps
- apply full throttle
- apply afterburners
- rotate at 160 - takeoff at 170/180 with full fuel weight

Flight:

- dependent on your altitude and speed choose 15/25/45/55 degrees wingweep
- max speed at sea level is mach 1.3, because of structural damage to engine inlets
- 15 degrees ws: used for takeoff/landing <320 knots
- 25 degrees ws: used for slow flight/refuelling < 370 knots
- 45 degrees ws: used for cruise at high altitude
- 55 degrees ws: used for high/low alt flight


Landing:

- ws 15 degrees
- use 1/2 or 2/2 flaps
- touchdown speed is 180/190 knots with full fuel load, or 140 nearly empty


XXXX TERRAIN AVOIDANCE SYSTEM XXXX

Available in OSG only

Master switch activates terrain avoidance system (ON/OFF), range switch (RNG) setting for short distance terrain recognition setting(2.5) used for low altitude flying (below 1000ft). Over 1000ft switch to the medium setting (5) that can clear whole mountain ridges. Once the terrain avoidance system gets active it automatically adds 1000ft to your current altitude and switches back to either terrain following mode (if active) or alt hold. The CLR PLN settings are important for low flying as it clears terrain below the aircraft. The settings are 0(off), 100ft, 300ft, 500ft and 1000ft. When used in combination with terrain follow (typical), then calculate 100ft security space to your agl altitude, otherwise the terrain avoidance system and you won't get much rest.
